Pushups, 10 reps (headline)

This is the best bodyweight exercise for your upper body: It builds a strong chest, shoulders, arms and abs.

The move: 
Get in a pushup position with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Keep your lower back flat and donâ€™t let your hips sag. Lower yourself and keep your elbows close to your body as you descend.
