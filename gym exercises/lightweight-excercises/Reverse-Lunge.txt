Reverse Lunges, 6 reps per side  (headline)

Reverse lunges help strengthen your thighs and hips. They’re simple and target each leg individually for more balance and stability.

The move: 
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Take a long step back — so your knees make two 90-degree angles at the bottom — and pull yourself back up with your forward leg. Start without dumbbells and advance to dumbbells or a barbell in either the back squat or front squat position.
