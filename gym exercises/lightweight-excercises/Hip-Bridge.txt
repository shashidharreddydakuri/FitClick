Hip Bridges, 10 reps   (headline)

Want strong legs and a nice-looking backside? Look no further than hip bridges! Theyâ€™re a simple way to strengthen your glutes and can even help release lower-back tension.

The move: 
Lie on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes to push your hips up. Repeat. Do not use your lower back to pull yourself up.
