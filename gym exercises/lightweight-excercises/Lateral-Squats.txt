Lateral Split Squats, 6 reps per side (headline)

By doing your squats side-to-side, you can build more strength in each leg than with regular squats while also targeting different muscles.

The move: 
Start with a very wide stance and your feet straight. Sit back into one hip and push that knee out. Repeat on the other side.
